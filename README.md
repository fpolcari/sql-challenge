# sql-challenge

In this challenge we were tasked to think of ourselves as newly hired data engineers working at a company called Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Our first major task was to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, we designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. Essentially we performed data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

Upon inspecting the CSV files we were also required to sketch an ERD of the tables by using a free online tool called QuickDBD. The image created has been included.

Finally the data analysis required us to include the following:

List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
